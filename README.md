# ScartixUI-mikasa

ScartixUI is a cutting-edge bridge between design and code, empowering teams to transform Figma components into production-ready UI code with ease. Whether you're a designer who wants to document component structures or a developer seeking a zero‑code solution, ScartixUI streamlines collaboration and accelerates your workflow:

Free Tier: Instantly extract a clean, human‑readable schema (JSON or TypeScript) that outlines your selected Figma component’s hierarchy and properties.

Pro Tier: Leverage AI to convert your Figma designs—including styles, layouts, and interactions—into fully scaffolded, framework‑specific components (React, Vue, Flutter, and more), enriched by designer annotations.

ScartixUI removes manual handoffs, eliminates ambiguity, and ensures that your final code matches the designer’s intent—faster, smarter, and with less overhead than ever before.
