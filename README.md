# ScartixUI-mikasa

ScartixUI is a cutting‑edge bridge between design and code, empowering teams to transform Figma components into production‑ready UI code with ease. Whether you're a designer who wants to document component structures or a developer seeking a zero‑code solution, ScartixUI streamlines collaboration and accelerates your workflow:

* **Free Tier**: Instantly extract a clean, human‑readable schema that outlines your selected Figma component’s hierarchy and properties. Additional features include:

  * Flexible output formats: JSON Schema, TypeScript interfaces, Mongoose/Zod definitions.
  * Capture basic interactions (click, hover, focus) as structured metadata.
  * Customizable export templates for embedding in documentation or automations.
  * Offline operation—no servers or API keys required.
  * CLI support for batch exports in CI/CD pipelines.

* **Pro Tier**: Leverage advanced AI to convert your Figma designs—including styles, layouts, and interactions—into fully scaffolded, framework‑specific components. Key enhancements:

  * Multi‑framework support: React, Vue, Flutter, Angular, and more.
  * Automatic mapping of colors, typography, and spacing to your design tokens.
  * Generation of interaction handlers (onClick, onHover) as typed callback props.
  * Deep integration of designer annotations for semantic accuracy.
  * Structured folder output with component files, Storybook stories, and test stubs.
  * Incremental updates: synchronize design changes without overwriting custom code.
  * Team access controls and private registry integration for enterprise workflows.

ScartixUI removes manual handoffs, eliminates ambiguity, and ensures that your final code matches the designer’s intent—faster, smarter, and with less overhead than ever before.
