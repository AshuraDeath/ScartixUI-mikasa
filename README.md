**ScartixUI** is a powerful bridge between design and code, built to streamline the collaboration between designers and developers. It enables teams to transform Figma components into production-ready UI code with minimal effort and maximum accuracy. Whether you're a designer looking to document component structures or a developer aiming to bypass manual handoffs, ScartixUI simplifies the entire process and accelerates your workflow.

## 🤔 Why ScartixUI?
- **Eliminate “Someone built it their own way”** mismatches by exporting a shared Figma-driven schema.  
- **Speed up full-stack development**: generate UI props, backend models, and API contracts from one design.  
- **Keep UI, API & data models in lock-step**: design changes flow instantly into code without guesswork.

## ✨ Features

### 🆓 Free Tier
- **Visual Schema Export**  
  Extract a nested JSON or TypeScript schema from any selected component tree.  
- **Auto-Generated API Stubs**  
  Produce JSON-Schema or OpenAPI snippets so backends match your UI contract out of the box.  
- **Shared Documentation Links**  
  Embed a “View Schema” link inside Figma for instant team handoffs.  
- **Mock Data Templates**  
  Generate realistic sample payloads or mock-server fixtures with one click.  
- **Schema Change Alerts**  
  Get notified in Figma when fields are renamed or removed, avoiding late-stage surprises.


### 🚀 Pro Tier

#### Zero-Code Revolution  
ScartixUI Pro is your all-in-one **Zero-Code** powerhouse: designers annotate layers and our AI orchestrates every step—from UI component through to backend endpoints—without you writing a single boilerplate line. Imagine: a single “Generate” click and you receive a complete, deployable full-stack scaffold that respects your brand tokens, enforces type safety, and wires up data flows automatically.  

#### Key Pro Capabilities
- **True Zero-Code Full-Stack Scaffolding**  
  Auto-generate:
  - **Frontend**: React/Vue/Flutter components with props, styles, hooks, and test stubs.  
  - **Backend**: NestJS/Express/Apollo controllers, services, DTOs/interfaces, validation schemas, and database models (Mongoose, Prisma, TypeORM).  
- **Context-Aware AI Prompts**  
  Your designer’s notes, node metadata, and interactions feed directly into the AI prompt—yielding idiomatic, framework-specific code that “just works” and follows your conventions.  
- **Dynamic Schema-Driven Watch Mode**  
  Live-sync changes in Figma: renamed props, new interactions, updated tokens—ScartixUI diffs your codebase and applies only the incremental updates, preserving any manual tweaks you made.  
- **End-to-End API Contract Sync**  
  One click to emit:
  - **GraphQL TypeDefs** + **Resolvers**  
  - **RESTful OpenAPI Spec** + **Route Handlers**  
  Your backend is ready to serve the exact data shape your UI expects.  
- **Design-Token & Theme Integration**  
  Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and breakpoints map to your central design-token repository (CSS variables, SCSS maps, JSON). No more magic numbers—ever.  
- **Interactive Mock & Live Preview**  
  Instantly spin up a local dev server where UI components call the generated APIs, complete with mock data or real database connections. Validate workflows end-to-end before you commit a line of code.  
- **Comprehensive Documentation Generation**  
  Designer annotations become:
  - JSDoc comments on React props  
  - PropType definitions  
  - Swagger docs for your APIs  
  - Typed interfaces for your services  
- **CI/CD & Versioning Hooks**  
  Integrates with GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to run “scartixui sync” pre-merge, automatically catching schema drifts and tagging your releases with design-version metadata.  
- **Custom Template & Plugin Marketplace**  
  Ship with prebuilt templates for common patterns—login forms, dashboards, e-commerce cards—and install community-built extensions for your own tech stack (e.g. Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit).

---

## 🚧 Roadmap
- **Widget Support** in Figma for persistent on-canvas panels  
- **VS Code Extension** for real-time code previews and diffing  
- **Marketplace Integration** for one-click installs inside Figma  
- **Expanded Backend Templates**: Prisma, TypeORM, Django, and more  
- **Multi-User Collaboration**: shared project settings and role-based access
