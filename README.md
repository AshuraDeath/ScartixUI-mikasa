## 🤔 Why ScartixUI?
- **Eliminate “Someone built it their own way”** mismatches by exporting a shared Figma-driven schema.  
- **Speed up full-stack development**: generate UI props, backend models, and API contracts from one design.  
- **Keep UI, API & data models in lock-step**: design changes flow instantly into code without guesswork.
